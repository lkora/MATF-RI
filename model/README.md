# Traffic intersection model


Created using AnyLogic, use newest version to open. 

When you run the model, use "load" button to start the simulation. What this does is that it opens the file.txt that is in the same directory as the model and reads the first 10 integers seperated by newline. 

Those integers in order represent:

- Number of vehicles in the left lane of the bottom road
- Number of vehicles in the right lane of the bottom road
- Number of vehicles in the left lane of the road to the left
- Number of vehicles in the right lane of the road to the left
- Number of vehicles in the left lane of the road to the right
- Number of vehicles in the right lane of the road to the right
- Number of vehicles in the left lane of the upper road
- Number of vehicles in the right lane of the upper road
- Seconds to change the west and east traffic light 
- Seconds to change the NS traffic light

When vehicles exit press the "end" button and exit. End button saves the statistics of the simulation into resutls.txt file.
